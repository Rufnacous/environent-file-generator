# Environment File Generator

I've created this script to solve my repeating problem of "How do I get a template environment file for my docker-compose into my git repo?"

Use a .envdefinition file to list each environment variable and define their input method. (Either user input or randomly generated)

It's my first ever bash script - be kind.
